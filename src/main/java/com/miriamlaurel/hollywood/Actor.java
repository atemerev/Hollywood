/**
 * Actor is the base class for all your own actors. You have to extend this class and provide <em>common interface</em>
 * and <em>states</em> (with implementation of common interface methods).
 * <p/>
 * You can't instantiate an Actor on your own since it's <b>always</b> an abstract class and doesn't provide
 * constructors. Instead, you should use following initialization call:
 * <p/>
 * <code>SomeActor actor = Hollywood.createActor(SomeActor.class)</code>
 * <p/>
 * Actor's base interface methods have the following signature:
 * <p/>
 * <code>public abstract Type method(args) [throws SomeException...]</code>
 * <p/>
 * An actor normally has multiple states (well, you could get with a single state, but then you don't really need
 * a full-scaled actor model, right?)
 * <p/>
 * States are implemented via internal classes <b>extending the current Actor subclass</b>. Thus if you have a
 * SomeActor implementation, your internal classes should have the following signature:
 * <p/>
 * <code>@State public static abstract class SomeInternalState extends SomeActor</code>
 * <p/>
 * (It's long and strange, but it has to be this way; it's Java, after all).
 * <p/>
 * One of the states should be marked with <code>@Initial</code> annotation -- it will be set right after the
 * initalization is complete. It's there you should set actor's dependencies and properties -- and you don't want
 * to define any additional behavior (as in implementing common interface methods -- except, maybe, the one method
 * that changes the state (see <code>setState(SomeState.class)</code> method).
 * <p/>
 * Other states can implement other methods of common interface. If some methods are not implemented (which is
 * possible since state subclasses are defined as abstract) -- they will throw UnsupportedOperationException on
 * attempt to call it from this specific state.
 * <p/>
 * For convenience, common interface methods can be marked with <code>@AllowedStates</code> annotation with a list
 * of state classes where this method is actually implemented. Currently, this annotation is ignored by Hollywood
 * framework and serves for documentation purposes only.
 * <p/>
 * Within the state methods (and only there), state can be changed with setState() method. If additional dependencies
 * should be set for specific state, it has to be done after <code>prepareState()</code> method call. Also, it's
 * <em>highly</em> recommended to change state in the last statement of the method (except for return). Otherwise you
 * have to be a certified magician.
 * <p/>
 * Commands which may change state <em>must</em> have the <code>synchrinized</code> modifier (to ensure that the order
 * of state transitions corresponds to the order the commands were called). Basic actor thread-safety (i.e. state
 * transition would wait for all running methods of the state to complete) is guaranteed by internal mechanisms, but
 * you still have to do your actor-specific synchronization manually if necessary. Synchronization bugs in Actors can
 * be really weird, so you are warned.
